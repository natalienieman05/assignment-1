        <h1>Winnie’s Origin Story</h1>
        <p>
            Winnie the Pooh was created by author A.A. Milne, inspired by his son Christopher Robin Milne and the
            boy’s stuffed animals. The first stories appeared in <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> and <em>The House at Pooh 
            Corner</em>. The character’s name came from a real bear at the London Zoo called Winnie, and “Pooh” was
            borrowed from a swan Christopher Robin had named.

            <h2>Adoption by Disney</h2>
            <p>
                In the 1960s, Disney adapted the stories into animated shorts, combining them into 
                <em>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</em>. This animated series followed Pooh as he went on 
                adventures with his friends filled with humor, heart, and lessons about friendship. 
                Pooh became a global icon, starring in films, TV shows, theme park rides, and merchandise.

            <h2>Pooh's Adventured</h2>
            <p>
                In one episode of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Pooh and his friends set 
                out on a quest to find honey after Pooh’s cupboards run bare. Along the way, they wander 
                into the Hundred Acre Wood, imagining it as a mysterious land full of “heffalumps and woozles” 
                they must outsmart. The adventure turns out to be more about friendship and teamwork than danger,
                 and Pooh ends up sharing the honey he finds with all his friends.
